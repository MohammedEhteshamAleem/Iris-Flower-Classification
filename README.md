Iris Flower Classification

Overview:
Iris Flower Classification is a machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Using classification algorithms, the model predicts the species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
